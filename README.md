# Calculator
Calculator project from The Odin Project
See [here](https://danielvec.github.io/Calculator/) for the calculator.

The calculator allows for multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, and exponentation. Answers are rounded to a maximum of two decimal places. Input is limited to a maximum of eight characters. I went against the project recomendation to evaluate only a single pair of numbers at a time because I preferred to be able to see everything on the calculator display before seeing the result. In hindsight, only evaluating a single pair of numbers at a time would have been better because it would allow for far more operations to continuosly take place.
